Cancerscope can be used to obtain quantitative diagnosis for cancer sequencing data using RNA sequencing information (gene expression profiles). You can obtain predictions from gene expression profiles stored in a text file, in 3 easy steps. Here's the code, assuming each row is a samples and each column is a gene:
```
import cancerscope as cs
scope_obj=cs.scope()
preds_from_file = scope_obj.get_predictions_from_file("path/to/my/file_with_geneexpression.txt")
```

You can also load the data into the sample (row) * gene (column) form in python first, and then obtain predictions as follows:
```
import cancerscope as cs
scope_obj=cs.scope()
preds_df_from_xdat = scope_obj.predict(X = test_x, x_features = test_features, x_features_genecode = test_genecode, x_sample_names=test_samples)
```
Notice that with this approach, you'll need to provide other information like a list of gene names (*test_features*), a string indicating the type of gene name used (*test_genecode*), and optionally, a list of sample names (*test_samples*).
